# Air Quality Clustering using Arduino: A Project to Analyze and Visualize Air Pollution Data
This project aims to create an air quality clustering system using Arduino and Python. The system can collect and process data from MQ135 gas sensor, MQ8 propane sensor, and MQ9 Carbon Monoxide sensor
# Data Collecting
In this project, i collected the data from 3 different condition:
1. In indoor clean room
2. Outdoor Conditions where there is vehicle pollution
3. Outdoor Conditions where there is combustion pollution
# Libraries
1. scikit learn for models and data preprocessing
2. numpy and pandas for data preprocessing
3. matplotlib for data visualisation
# Result
The result can be seen in the aur_quality.ipynb file. UNfortunately, i can't deploy the model into the system yet, because there is limited model that can be transformed into c++
from micromlgen library
